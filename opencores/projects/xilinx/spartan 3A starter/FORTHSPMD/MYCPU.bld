INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'Clock', used in period specification
   'TS_Clock', was traced into DCM_SP instance DCM_SP. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLK0: <TIMESPEC TS_myRAM_infrastructure_top0_clk_dcm0_clk0dcm = PERIOD
   "myRAM_infrastructure_top0_clk_dcm0_clk0dcm" TS_Clock HIGH 50%>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'Clock', used in period specification
   'TS_Clock', was traced into DCM_SP instance DCM_SP. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLK90: <TIMESPEC TS_myRAM_infrastructure_top0_clk_dcm0_clk90dcm = PERIOD

INFO:ConstraintSystem - The Period constraint <PERIOD = 20 ns HIGH 40 %;>
   [MYCPU.ucf(27)], is specified using the Net Period method which is not
   recommended. Please use the Timespec PERIOD method.

Done...

   DCM_SP to 16.000000 ns based on the period specification (<TIMESPEC
   "TS_Clock" = PERIOD "Clock" 16.0 ns HIGH 50 %;> [MYCPU.ucf(19)]).
