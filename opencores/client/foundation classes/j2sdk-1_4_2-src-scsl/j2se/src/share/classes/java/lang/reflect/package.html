Provides classes and interfaces for obtaining reflective
information about classes and objects.  Reflection allows
programmatic access to information about the fields, methods
and constructors of loaded classes, and the use reflected fields,
methods, and constructors to operate on their underlying
counterparts on objects, within security restrictions.
<p>
<code>AccessibleObject</code> allows supression of access checks if
the necessary <code>ReflectPermission</code> is available.
<p>
<code>Arrays</code> provides static methods to dynamically create and
access arrays.
<p>
Classes in this package, along with <code>java.lang.Class</code>
accommodate applications such as debuggers, interpreters, object
inspectors, class browsers, and services such as Object Serialization
and JavaBeans that need access to either the public members of a
target object (based on its runtime class) or the members declared by
a given class.
