Provides user interface objects built according to the
Basic look and feel. The Basic look and feel provides default 
behavior used by many look and feel packages. 
It contains components, layout managers,
events, event listeners, and adapters. 
You can subclass the classes in
this package to create your own customized look and feel.

<p>These classes are designed to be used while the
corresponding <code>LookAndFeel</code> class has been
installed
(<code>UIManager.setLookAndFeel(new <i>XXX</i>LookAndFeel())</code>).
Using them while a different <code>LookAndFeel</code> is installed
may produce unexpected results, including exceptions.
Additionally, changing the <code>LookAndFeel</code>
maintained by the <code>UIManager</code> without updating the
corresponding <code>ComponentUI</code> of any
<code>JComponent</code>s may also produce unexpected results,
such as the wrong colors showing up, and is generally not
encouraged.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
Most of the Swing API is <em>not</em> thread safe.
