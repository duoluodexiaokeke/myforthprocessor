A package of the Java Image I/O API dealing with reading and writing
metadata.

<p>

When reading an image, its per-stream and per-image metadata is made
available as an <code>IIOMetadata</code> object.  The internals of
this object are specific to the plug-in that created it.  Its contents
may be accessed in the form of an XML <code>Document</code>, which is
implemented as a tree of <code>IIOMetadataNode</code> objects.

<p>

When writing an image, its metadata may be set by defining or
modifying an <code>IIOMetadata</code> object.  Such an object may be
obtained from an <code>ImageWriter</code> or
<code>ImageTranscoder</code> (from the
<code>javax.imageio</code> package).  Once such an object has
been obtained, its contents may be set of modified via a
<code>Document</code> consisting of <code>IIOMetadataNode</code>s.
The document format may optionally be described using an
<code>IIOMetadataFormat</code> object.

<p>

The format of the metadata contained in the XML <code>Document</code>
is identified by a string which appears as the root node of the tree
of <code>IIOMetadataNode</code> objects.  This string contains a version
number, e.g. "javax_imageio_jpeg_image_1.0".  Readers and writers may
support multiple versions of the same basic format and the Image I/O
API has methods that allow specifying which version to use by passing
the string to the method/constructor used to obtain an <code>IIOMetadata</code>
object.  In some cases, a more recent version may not be strictly
compatible with a program written expecting an older version (for
an example, see the Native Metadata Format section of the JPEG Metadata
Usage Notes below).

<p>

Plug-ins may choose to support a <A
HREF="doc-files/standard_metadata.html">standard (plug-in neutral)
format</A>.  This format does not provide lossless encoding of
metadata, but allows a portion of the metadata to be accessed in a
generic manner.

<p>

Each of the standard plug-ins supports a so-called "native" metadata
format, which encodes its metadata losslessly:

<ul>
<li>
<A HREF="doc-files/gif_metadata.html">
GIF metadata
</A>

<li>
<A HREF="doc-files/jpeg_metadata.html">
JPEG metadata
</A>

<li>
<A HREF="doc-files/png_metadata.html">
PNG metadata
</A>
</ul>
