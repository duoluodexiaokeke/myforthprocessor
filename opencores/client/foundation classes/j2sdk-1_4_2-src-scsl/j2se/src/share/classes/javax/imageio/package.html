The main package of the Java Image I/O API.

<p>

Many common image I/O operations may be performed using the static
methods of the <code>ImageIO</code> class.

<p>

This package contains the basic classes and interfaces for describing
the contents of image files, including metadata and thumbnails
(<code>IIOImage</code>); for controlling the image reading process
(<code>ImageReader</code>, <code>ImageReadParam</code>, and
<code>ImageTypeSpecifier</code>) and image writing process
(<code>ImageWriter</code> and <code>ImageWriteParam</code>); for
performing transcoding between formats (<code>ImageTranscoder</code>),
and for reporting errors (<code>IIOException</code>).
