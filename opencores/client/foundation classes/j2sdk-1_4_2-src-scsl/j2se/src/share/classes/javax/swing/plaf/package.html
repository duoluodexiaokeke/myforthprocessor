Provides one interface and many abstract classes that
Swing uses to provide its pluggable look-and-feel capabilities.  Its
classes are subclassed and implemented by look and feel UIs 
such as Basic and the Java look and feel (Metal).
This package is only used by developers who
cannot create a new look and feel by subclassing existing
look-and-feel components (such as those provided
by the <code>javax.swing.plaf.basic</code> and
<code>javax.swing.plaf.metal</code> packages).

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
Most of the Swing API is <em>not</em> thread safe.
