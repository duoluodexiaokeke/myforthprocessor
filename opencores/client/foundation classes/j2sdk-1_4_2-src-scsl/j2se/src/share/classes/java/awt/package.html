Contains all of the classes for creating user
interfaces and for painting graphics and images. A user interface object such as a button or a
scrollbar is called, in AWT terminology, a component. The Component class is the root of all
AWT components. See Component for a detailed description of properties that all AWT 
components share.
<p>
Some components fire events when a user interacts with the components. The AWTEvent
class and its subclasses are used to represent the events that AWT components can fire. See
AWTEvent for a description of the AWT event model.
<p>
A container is a component that can contain components and other containers. A con
tainer can also have a layout manager that controls the visual placement of components in the
container. The AWT package contains several layout manager classes and an interface for
building your own layout manager. See Container and LayoutManager for more information.
