# Validation messages, won't normally show up unless validation is
# being performed.  Note that V-022 relates to a spec bug:  there
# are both a WFC and VC on undefined PEs.  If that's a WVC violation
# there's no need for the VC, ever; and "standalone" would then affect
# WF-ness.  For the moment this assumes it's to be a VC not a WFC.
