<listitem><para>to sign Java ARchive (<acronym>JAR</acronym>) files, and</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>to verify the signatures and integrity of signed <acronym>JAR</acronym> files.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist></para>
<para>The <acronym>JAR</acronym> feature enables the packaging of class files, images, sounds, and other digital data in a single file for faster and easier distribution. A tool named <command>jar</command> enables developers to produce <acronym>JAR</acronym> files. (See <citerefentry><refentrytitle>jar</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.)</para>
<para>A digital signature is a string of bits that is computed from some data (the data being "signed") and the private key of an entity (a person, company, and so on). Like a handwritten signature, a digital signature has many useful characteristics:<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Its authenticity can be verified, via a computation that uses the public key corresponding to the private key used to generate the signature.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It cannot be forged, assuming the private key is kept secret.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It is a function of the data signed and thus cannot be claimed to be the signature for other data as well.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The signed data cannot be changed. If it is, the signature will no longer verify as being authentic.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para>
<para>In order for an entity's signature to be generated for a file, the entity must first have a public/private key pair associated with it, and also one or more certificates authenticating its public key. A certificate is a digitally signed statement from one entity, saying that the public key of some other entity has a particular value.</para>
<para><command>jarsigner</command> uses key and certificate information from a keystore to generate digital signatures for <acronym>JAR</acronym> files. A keystore is a database of private keys and their associated X.509 certificate chains authenticating the corresponding public keys. The <command>keytool</command> utility is used to create and administer keystores. (See <citerefentry><refentrytitle>
keytool</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.)</para>
<para><command>jarsigner</command> uses an entity's private key to generate a signature. The signed <acronym>JAR</acronym> file contains, among other things, a copy of the certificate from the keystore for the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the file. <command>jarsigner</command> can verify the digital signature of the signed <acronym>JAR</acronym> file using the certificate
inside it (in its signature block file).</para>
<para>At this time, <command>jarsigner</command> can only sign <acronym>JAR</acronym> files created by the JDK <command>jar</command> tool or zip files. (<acronym>JAR</acronym> files are the same as zip files, except they also have a <filename>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</filename> file. Such a file will automatically be created when <command>jarsigner</command> signs a zip file.)</para>
<para>The default <command>jarsigner</command> behavior is to sign a <acronym>JAR</acronym> file. Use the <option>verify</option> option to have it verify a signed <acronym>JAR</acronym> file instead.</para>

<indexterm id="jarsigner-1-indx-4"><primary sortas="jarsigner">jarsigner &mdash; JAR signing and verification tool </primary><secondary>Keystore Aliases</secondary></indexterm><para>All keystore entities are accessed via unique aliases.</para>
<para>When using <command>jarsigner</command> to sign a <acronym>JAR</acronym> file, you must specify the alias for the keystore entry containing the private key needed to generate the signature. For example, the following will sign the <acronym>JAR</acronym> file named <literal>MyJARFile.jar</literal>, using the private key associated with the alias <literal>duke</literal> in the keystore named <literal>
mystore</literal> in the "working" directory. Since no output file is specified, it overwrites <literal>MyJARFile.jar</literal> with the signed <acronym>JAR</acronym> file.<informalexample><screen>example% <userinput>jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -storepass 
   myspass -keypass dukekeypasswd MyJARFile.jar duke</userinput></screen>
</informalexample></para>
<para>Keystores are protected with a password, so the store password (in this case, <literal>myspass</literal>) must be specified. You will be prompted for it if you don't specify it on the command line. Similarly, private keys are protected in a keystore with a password, so the private key's password (in this case, <literal>dukekeypasswd</literal>) must be specified, and you will be prompted for it
if you do not specify it on the command line and it is not the same as the store password.</para>

The keystore is by default stored in a file named <literal>.keystore</literal> in the

<refsect2><title>Keystore Implementation</title>
<indexterm id="jarsigner-1-indx-6"><primary sortas="jarsigner">jarsigner &mdash; JAR signing and verification tool </primary><secondary>Keystore Implementation</secondary></indexterm><para>A keystore implementation is a concrete implementation of the <literal>KeyStore</literal> abstract class provided in the <literal>java.security</literal> package. This class supplies well-defined interfaces to access
and modify the information in a keystore.</para>
<para>Currently, there are two command-line tools that make use of <literal>KeyStore</literal>. These are <command>keytool</command> and <command>jarsigner</command>. There is also a GUI-based tool named <command>policytool</command>. Since <literal>KeyStore</literal> is publicly available, JDK users can write additional security applications that use it.</para>
<para>There is a built-in default implementation, provided by Sun Microsystems. It implements the keystore as a file, utilizing a proprietary keystore type (format) named "JKS". It protects each private key with its individual password, and also protects the integrity of the entire keystore with a (possibly different) password.</para>
<para>Keystore implementations are provider-based. More specifically, the application interfaces supplied by <literal>KeyStore</literal> are implemented in terms of a "Service Provider Interface" (SPI). That is, there is a corresponding abstract <literal>KeystoreSpi</literal> class, also in the <literal>java.security</literal> package, which defines the Service Provider Interface methods that "providers"
must implement. (The term "provider" refers to a package or a set of packages that supply a concrete implementation of a subset of services that can be accessed by the Java Security API.) Thus, to provide a keystore implementation, clients must implement a provider and supply a <literal>KeystoreSpi</literal> subclass implementation, as described in <replaceable>How to Implement a Provider for the Java
Cryptography Architecture</replaceable>. </para>
<para>Applications can choose different types of keystore implementations from different providers, using the <literal>getInstance</literal> factory method supplied in the <literal>KeyStore</literal> class. A keystore type defines the storage and data format of the keystore information, and the algorithms used to protect private keys in the keystore and the integrity of the keystore itself. Keystore
implementations of different types are not compatible.</para>
<para><command>keytool</command> works on any file-based keystore implementation. (It treats the keytore location that is passed to it at the command line as a filename and converts it to a <literal>FileInputStream</literal>, from which it loads the keystore information.) The <command>jarsigner</command> and  <command>policytool</command> tools, on the other hand, can read a keystore from any location
that can be specified using a URL.</para>
<para>For <command>jarsigner</command> and <command>keytool</command>, you can specify a keystore type at the command line, via the <option>storetype</option> option. For <command>policytool</command>, you can specify a keystore type via the "Change Keystore" command in the Edit menu.</para>
<para>If you do not explicitly specify a keystore type, the tools choose a keystore implementation based simply on the value of the <literal>keystore.type</literal> property specified in the security properties file. The security properties file is called  <literal>java.security</literal>, and it resides in the security properties directory,  <filename>java.home/lib/security</filename>, where  <literal>
java.home</literal> is the runtime environment's directory (the jre directory in the SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime Environment).</para>
<para>Each tool gets the <literal>keystore.type</literal> value and then examines all the currently-installed providers until it finds one that implements keystores of that type. It then uses the keystore implementation from that provider.</para>
<para>The <literal>KeyStore</literal> class defines a static method named <literal>getDefaultType</literal> that lets applications and applets retrieve the value of the <literal>keystore.type</literal> property. The following line of code creates an instance of the default keystore type (as specified in the  <literal>keystore.type</literal> property):<informalexample><programlisting>KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
</programlisting>
</informalexample></para>
<para>The default keystore type is "jks" (the proprietary type of the keystore implementation provided by Sun). This is specified by the following line in the security properties file:<informalexample><programlisting>keystore.type=jks</programlisting>
</informalexample></para>
<para>To have the tools utilize a keystore implementation other than the default, change that line to specify a different keystore type.</para>
<para>For example, if you have a provider package that supplies a keystore implementation for a keystore type called <literal>pkcs12</literal>, change the line to<informalexample><programlisting>keystore.type=pkcs12</programlisting>
</informalexample></para>
<para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Case doesn't matter in keystore type designations. For example, "JKS" would be considered the same as "jks".</para>

If the alias name has fewer than 8 characters, the full alias name is used. If the alias name contains any characters that are not allowed
in a signature file name, each such character is converted to an underscore ("_") character in forming the file name. Legal characters include letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.</para>

<para>If that is not the case, a less optimized verification is required to ensure that the hash in each source file information section in the <literal>.SF</literal> file equals the hash of its corresponding section in the manifest file (see &ldquo;The Signature (<literal>.SF</literal>) File&rdquo;).</para>
<para>One reason the hash of the manifest file that is stored in the <literal>.SF</literal> file header may not equal the hash of the current manifest file would be that one or more files were added to the <acronym>JAR</acronym> file (using the <command>jar</command> tool) after the signature (and thus the <literal>.SF</literal> file) was generated. When the <command>jar</command> tool is used to add
files, the manifest file is changed (sections are added to it for the new files), but the <literal>.SF</literal> file is not. A verification is still considered successful if none of the files that were in the <acronym>JAR</acronym> file when the signature was generated have been changed since then, which is the case if the hashes in the non-header sections of the <literal>.SF</literal> file equal the
hashes of the corresponding sections in the manifest file.</para></listitem>
